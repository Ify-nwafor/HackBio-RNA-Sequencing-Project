## ü©∫ Background and Rationale

Periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are among the most devastating complications of orthopedic implants. They increase morbidity, prolong hospital stays, and often require costly revision surgeries. *Staphylococcus aureus*‚Äîparticularly methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA)‚Äîis a leading cause of PJIs.

One hallmark of *S. aureus* pathogenesis is its ability to switch between distinct phenotypes during infection:

- **Acute phase:** Bacteria exhibit an aggressive planktonic growth mode, expressing virulence factors such as toxins, adhesins, and immune evasion genes.  
- **Chronic phase:** Bacteria transition into a biofilm-like state, downregulating overt virulence genes and upregulating stress response, metabolic rewiring, and persistence pathways.

This switch underlies the resilience of chronic PJIs to antibiotics and immune clearance.

## üß† Functional Enrichment Analysis (using ShinyGO)

Functional enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was conducted using ShinyGO v0.80 with _Staphylococcus aureus_ subsp. aureus NCTC 8325 as the reference genome. Out of 21 DEGs, 13 (62%) were successfully mapped to annotated S. aureus STRING database entries. Enrichment analysis revealed several significantly overrepresented pathways (FDR < 0.05), primarily associated with lipid metabolism and fatty acid degradation.

Terms such as lipid oxidation, fatty acid Œ≤-oxidation, lipid catabolic process, and AMP-binding and ABC transporter-like proteins were enriched (FDR = 7.0 √ó 10‚Åª¬≥ to 1.7 √ó 10‚Åª¬≤). These processes indicate metabolic reprogramming of _S. aureus_ during infection, likely reflecting enhanced utilization of host fatty acids and energy conservation strategies under stress conditions. Such metabolic adaptations are consistent with the bacterial transition to a chronic, biofilm-associated phenotype, which supports persistence and antibiotic tolerance in periprosthetic joint infections.

## üßæ Conclusion
This study provides transcriptomic insight into the adaptive strategies employed by _Staphylococcus aureus_ during acute and chronic phases of periprosthetic joint infection. Differential expression and enrichment analyses revealed a strong association between chronic infection and genes involved in lipid oxidation and fatty acid catabolism. These findings highlight a metabolic transition that favors energy conservation, stress tolerance, and persistence within the host. Although only a subset of genes were functionally annotated, the enrichment of lipid metabolic pathways highlights the role of metabolic reprogramming in promoting chronic infection phenotypes. These results contribute to our understanding of _S. aureus_ pathogenesis and may inform future therapeutic approaches targeting metabolic pathways essential for bacterial persistence.
